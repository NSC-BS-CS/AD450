    "## Grouping Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The expressiveness of Python and pandas allows complex group operations using any function that accepts a pandas object or NumPy array. This can include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Splitting a pandas object into pieces using one or more keys\n",
    "- Calculating group summary statistics\n",
    "- Applying within-group transformations or other manipulations\n",
    "- Computing pivot tables and cross-tabulations\n",
    "- Performing quantile analysis and other statistical group analyses\n",
    "\n",
    "### GroupBy Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "Group operations involve the `split-apply-combine` mechanism.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data are split into groups based on one or more keys\n",
    "2. A function is applied to each group\n",
    "3. Results of the function application are combined into a new object\n",
    "\n",
    "Grouping keys can take many forms, and the keys do not have to be all of the same type.\n",
    "\n",
    "pandas `groupby` method returns a GroupBy object that can be re-used.\n",
    "\n",
    "DataFrame columns can be used as the group keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "Numeric aggregations will exclude `nuisance` (non-numeric) columns from the result\n",
    "\n",
    "By default `groupby` groups on axis=0, but can group on any of the other axes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Iterating over groups\n",
    "\n",
    "The GroupBy object supports iteration, generating a sequence of 2-tuples containing the group name along with the chunk of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indexing a GroupBy object created from a DataFrame with a column name or array of column names has the effect of column subsetting for aggregation. This means that:\n",
    "```\n",
    "df.groupby('key1')['data1']\n",
    "```\n",
    "is essentially the same as:\n",
    "```\n",
    "df['data1'].groupby(df['key1'])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reindexing\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of GroupBys are often multi-indexed. This is typically not the form you want for your analysis. This means that you will want to reset your index or remove multi indexes on your columns. See below for examples of that. "
