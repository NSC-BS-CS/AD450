    "Data cleaning and transformation is one of the situations where importing from a python file is helpful. For example in this [project](https://github.com/hlandrus/olympic_climbing_prediction) I created a [notebook](https://github.com/hlandrus/olympic_climbing_prediction/blob/main/explore-ifsc-data.ipynb) that had most of my model building and testing while the file [data_processing.py](https://github.com/hlandrus/olympic_climbing_prediction/blob/main/data_processing.py) contained the data processing required clean and transform the data. I did this because the data processing doesn't add understanding to the project. Instead I focused on keeping the interesting things in the notebook and the less interesting things in a python file. You could do this with many things like putting a model training and testing pipeline into a file and only running and displaying the results in your notebook. Overall think about putting what you want to communicate and share in the notebook and what is not helpful for communicating your findings into a file.\n",
